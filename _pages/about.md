I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://cispa.de/en">CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security</a>, advised by <a href="https://abojchevski.github.io">Aleksandar Bojchevski</a>.
</p> 

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
My research focuses on trustworthy machine learning, specifically exploring the robustness of graph neural networks, differentially private graph learning and generative models.
</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
I have obtained a B.Ss. and M.Sc. in Computer Science from Sapienza University of Rome where I was awarded as an outstanding student for the a.y. 2020/2021. 
While away from research, I enjoy doing sports and hiking in nature. For longer breaks, I indulge in travel particularly backpacking.
