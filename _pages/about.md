I am a Ph.D. candidate at the CISPAâ€¯Helmholtz Center for Information Security, where I am advised by Aleksandarâ€¯Bojchevski. My research explores the inner workings of neural networks to make their predictions more trustworthy.

My current work focuses on **data attribution** -- quantifying how each training example shapes what a model learns -- and on {**trustworthy**, **graph**}**-machine learning**.

I earned both my B.Sc.â€¯andâ€¯M.Sc. in Computer Science from Sapienzaâ€¯University ofâ€¯Rome, where I was honoured as an outstanding graduate student (a.y.â€¯2020/2021).

Outside of research (and time permitting) I enjoy travelling. Countries I have visited so far include: ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¹ ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¿ ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡· ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡¸ ğŸ‡®ğŸ‡¸ ğŸ‡©ğŸ‡ª ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡¹ ğŸ‡³ğŸ‡± ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ ğŸ‡µğŸ‡ª ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡· ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦ ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡ª
